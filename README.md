I’m **Durga Baskar** — not just another engineering student,  
but a woman building her world from scratch — with logic, love, and a little rebellion.

📍 Raised in Chennai. Rooted in courage.  
💻 Learned to code not because I had to — but because I wanted more.  
🎓 EEE by degree, but my heart beats for **Java**, design, and doing things differently.  
🛠️ I touch tech like art — every project, every line, every click with intent.  
💬 I don’t fear interviews or setbacks — I speak up, I show up, I glow through it.  

This repo?  
It’s not just a README —  
It’s a real me.

Still learning. Still growing. Still bold.  
And no, I’m not stopping here. 💫
